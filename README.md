## Abi Travers

Only 7% of the population are [ENFP’s](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality). Of those 7% only 0.5% chose to be software engineers.  I am one of those. If you want an energetic, enthusiastic and open-minded junior software developer, who is passionate about learning new skills and developing others then you have come to the right CV.

I have experience working in an Agile tech team and implementing XP values into that team.

## Skills ##

#### Fast Self-Taught Leaner Who Thrives Under Pressure ####

A tenacious ability to teach myself new skills quickly and apply them while under pressure:

Inspitrip:
- Turned this start-up around from 0-2 customers per month to 5-7. This secured an investment of $100,000 for a 10% stake in the product.

- Arrived in Vietnam with no contacts or experience in marketing. Secured a position within 2 weeks then progressed to leading the growth of the company.

- To close my skill gap, I taught myself marketing then created the growth strategy (which was later used to secure the investment). Helped put together the marketing team & create business processes. I managed other team members. I did all of this with no prior experience.

- Implemented lean start-up methodology; rapid experimentation followed by careful analysis to inform the next steps. This was used for both the product and growth marketing of it.



#### Excellent Communicator ####

I have a proven ability to effectively communicate with all-types of people:


- At the Energy Institute I worked directly with ex CEOs, CTOs and C-suit management of large oil and gas companies (including BP and Exxon) to assemble co-written papers to influence government policies.

- At UK Power Networks I worked with internal C-suite management and contracting companies (such as Morgan Sindall, ABA) to negotiate significant cost savings. For example I reduced a £12m project to £7.8m.

- My greatest achievement was persuading the CEO, despite a pay and hire freeze, to offer Master’s degree courses to other graduates to support their enhanced development.  

- I was the only English speaker and non-developer while leading the growth at a Vietnamese startup.


## Additional Skills & Qualifications ##

- Photoshop and Illustrate (self-taught). Used to create adverts and landing pages for clients while at Growth Hacking Asia and Lebrun Black consulting.

- Prince 2 Project Management – Practitioner Award.
