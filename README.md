## Abi Travers
Junior software developer currently looking for a role as a full-stack web developer. I am fascinated by how technology can be used to improve human experience.

I was first drawn to the idea of software development while working on a commercial graduate scheme at UKPower Networks. I was tasked with project managing large commercial disputes and wanted to write software which made my job more efficient and took away the human error involved with working with large data-sets. I am fascinate by how powerful data can be when harnessed correctly. 

I found a love for crafting technology products while working as a growth hacker( marketer) for Tech start-ups. I wanted to dig deeper into the technologies I was using everyday to see how I could improve and build on them. 

I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to teach myself new skills and then excel in adapting these to any situation:

I turned a tech start-up round when it was about to close down. I taught myself online growth marketing. I achieved a masters in International Development where I helped change local government taxation in Uganda. I project managed multi-million pound catastrophe projects for London's Electricity Distribution Network while working on their graduate leadership scheme. 

I am happiest when up against a huge challenge and developing others. This is why I have chosen a career in software development with its continuous problems and infinite depth of learning.


## PROJECTS
| Project       | Summary       | Technologies  | Testing |
| ------------- |---------------| --------------|---------|
| 1. Rock Paper Scissors: Part One ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/rps-challenge)) | Three weeks into coding at Makers academy I attempted this challenge after having spent the week prior to it learning the technologies involved. Compared it to other projects to see how far I've come. |Ruby, Sinatra | RSpec |
| 2. Rock Paper Scissors: Part Two ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/rps-challenge-improved-))| Two months in, I re-visited it to see how much I had improved. |Ruby, Sinatra | RSpec |
| 3. Marryo-land: ([Github](https://github.com/nick-otter/marryo-land))| A re-make of Super Mario Land. The similarity is uncanny. | JavaScript, HTML5  | Jasmine, Mocha |
| 4. Bank: ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/Bank_Tech_Test_Redesigned))| An object-orientated, test driven solution to the bank kata. Second attempt to track my improvement. | Ruby  | RSpec |
| 5. Quark: ([Github](https://github.com/FreddieCodes/PDAF-Text-editor)) | A text editor tailored for those who write code. Used as a desktop or web app it interacts with your local file system and automatically formats the code you are writing based on the language you are using. | Electron, Javascript, Node JS, CSS, HTML | Spectron |


## Skills ##

#### Fast Self-Taught Leaner Who Thrives Under Pressure ####

A tenacious ability to teach myself new skills quickly and apply them while under pressure:

Inspitrip:

- Arrived in Vietnam with no contacts or experience in marketing. Secured a position within 2 weeks then progressed to leading the growth of the company.

- Turned this start-up around from 0-2 customers per month to 5-7. This secured an investment of $100,000 for a 10% stake in the product.

- To close my skill gap, I taught myself marketing then created the growth strategy (which was later used to secure the investment). Helped put together the marketing team & create business processes. I managed other team members. I did all of this with no prior experience.

- Taught myself and implemented lean start-up methodology; rapid experimentation followed by careful analysis to inform the next steps. This was used for both the product and growth marketing of it.


#### Excellent Communicator ####

I have a proven ability to effectively communicate with all-types of people:

- At the Energy Institute I worked directly with ex CEOs, CTOs and C-suit management of large oil and gas companies (including BP and Exxon) to assemble co-written papers to influence government policies.

- At UK Power Networks I worked with internal C-suite management and contracting companies (such as Morgan Sindall, ABA) to negotiate significant cost savings. For example, I reduced a £12m project to £7.8m.

- My greatest achievement was persuading the CEO, despite a pay and hire freeze, to offer Master’s degree courses to other graduates to support their enhanced development.  

- I was the only English speaker and non-developer while leading the growth at a Vietnamese start-up.

- Wrote ad copy in both of the tech start-ups I worked at. Created the blog for Inspitrip where as well as writing my own post (one of which increased our website traffic from 10 per month to 10,000 in 2 days) I edited and quality-controlled all the other writers.
