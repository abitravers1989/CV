## Abi Travers

"Never be average, stay curious, stay kind, never settle."
My personal motto.

Like Dr Seuss, I am creative and analytical, I think differently to solve any complex challenges and I have a deep compassion for people and drive to make the world a better place.

I am a soon-to-be full stack developer looking to enhance the skills I developed at Makers Academy (a 12 week intensive development boot camp). I write about how I am learning and what I am struggling with [here](http://lebrunblack.com/), in the hope that this will help others. My initial interest is in security and software systems. I hope to bring a unique perspective to this area, whilst coaching others who are less experienced.
 

As someone who is intrinsically motivated, I am happiest when I am facing a challenge. I continuously take on tasks above my skill set which is why I am drawn to coding, where there is always more to learn. I found my interest for software and web development initially through my work as a growth hacker for Tech startups while living in Vietnam and Indonesia.
 

## Skills ##

#### Fast Self-Taught Leaner Who Thrives Under Pressure ####

A tenacious ability to teach myself new skills quickly and apply them while under pressure:

Inspitrip:
- Turned this start-up around from 0-2 new customers per month to 9-10 per month while securing an investment of $100,000 for a 10% stake.

- Arrived in Vietnam with no contacts or experience in marketing. Secured a position within 2 weeks then progressed to leading the growth of the company.

- To close my skill gap, I taught myself marketing then created the growth strategy (which was later used to secure the investment). Helped put together the marketing team. Created business processes and managed other team members despite having no prior experience.

- Implemented lean start-up methodology which based on rapid experimentation followed by careful analysis in order to inform the steps to take next. This covered both the product itself and its growth marketing.




#### Excellent Communicator ####

I have a proven ability to effectively communicate with all-types of people:


- At the Energy Institute I worked directly with ex CEOs, CTOs and C-suit management of large oil and gas companies (including BP and Exxon) to assemble co-written papers to influence government policies.

- At UK Power Networks I worked with internal C-suite management and contracting companies (such as Morgan Sindall, ABA) to negotiate significant cost savings e.g. I reduced a £12m project to £7.8m.

- My greatest achievement was persuading the CEO, despite a pay and hire freeze, to offer Master’s degree courses to other graduates to support enhanced development.  

- I was the only English speaker and non-developer while leading the growth at a Vietnamese startup.
