## Abi Travers
 
I was drawn to software development while working on a commercial graduate scheme at UKPower Networks. I wanted to write software to reduce human error when working with large data sets and make my team more efficient and effective. I found my love for crafting technology products while working as a growth hacker in agile tech start-ups. I wanted to work together with the tech team to improve and develop the tools we had, instead of just passing on requests. I created my own website at weekends, sparking my passion for the web: http://lebrunblack.com/.

The moment I started programming I feel in love with the continuous feedback, reflection and improvement cycle it allowed. I got such a satisfactory feeling from a test passing or a working function. The moment I started pair programming I realised just how powerful two connected minds working on a problem in sync was.  
From then onwards this was my passion and the way I wanted to work in the future.
 
I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to teach myself new skills and then excel in adapting to any situation and in turn, passing my learning on to others. I have developed and enhanced these partnered learning skills from my early progression in UKPower Networks from the Graduate Scheme into the Commercial Disputes Team, then in leading the New Graduate Team.  With more freedom to explore, working in growth hacking my shared learning passion helped lead the direction of the team, including hiring new members and expanding the business. I love to share new skills I learn, so thrive when I am around other passionate people.

I enjoy working in challenging environments and developing or learning from others. For this reason I have chosen a career in software development with its continuous problems and infinite depth of learning.

| 1. Rock Paper Scissors: Part One ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/rps-challenge))  Part Two ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/rps-challenge-improved-))| Three weeks into coding at Makers academy I attempted this challenge after having spent the week prior to it learning the technologies involved. Two months in, I re-visited it to see how much I had improved. |Ruby, Sinatra | RSpec |
| 3. Marryo-land: ([Github](https://github.com/nick-otter/marryo-land))| A re-make of Super Mario Land. The similarity is uncanny. | JavaScript, HTML5  | Jasmine, Mocha |
| 4. Driftrock: ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/driftrock))| Command line app which interacts with a public API and allows a user to query marketing data. COMPLETED POST MAKERS. | Ruby, JSON API | RSpec |
| 5. Quark: ([Github](https://github.com/FreddieCodes/PDAF-Text-editor)) | A text editor tailored for those who write code.

## Skills ##
#### Fast Self-Taught Learner Who Thrives Under Pressure ####
Inspitrip:
- Arrived in Vietnam with no contacts or experience in marketing. Secured a position and then progressed to playing a key role in leading the growth of the company.

- Organised monthly talks where each member of the team could teach others something about what they were working on/learning.
 
- Upon arrival this start-up averaged 0-2 customers per month which increased to 5-7 per month on exit. This secured an investment of $100,000 for a 10% stake in the product.
 
- To close my skill gap, I taught myself marketing then created the growth strategy (which was later used to secure the investment). Helped put together the marketing team & create business processes. I managed other team members. I did all of this with no prior experience.
 
- Taught myself and implemented lean start-up methodology; rapid experimentation followed by careful analysis to inform the next steps. This was used for both the product and growth marketing of it.
 
#### Excellent Communicator ####
I have a proven ability to effectively communicate with all-types of people:
- At the Energy Institute I worked directly with ex CEOs, CTOs and C-suite management of large oil and gas companies (including BP and Exxon) to assemble co-written papers to influence government policies.
 
- At UK Power Networks I worked with internal C-suite management and contracting companies (such as Morgan Sindall, ABA) to negotiate significant cost savings, reducing project costs from £12m to £7.8m on one project.
 
- My greatest achievement was persuading the CEO, despite a pay and hire freeze, to offer Master’s degree courses to other graduates to support their enhanced development.  
 
- I was the only English speaker and non-developer while leading the growth at a Vietnamese start-up.
 
- Wrote ad copy in both of the tech start-ups I worked at. Created the blog for Inspitrip where as well as writing my own post (one of which increased our website traffic from 10 per month to 10,000 in 2 days) I edited and quality-controlled all the other writers. 
 
## Additional Skills & Qualifications ##
 
- Photoshop and Illustrate (self-taught). Used to create adverts and landing pages for clients while at Growth Hacking Asia and Lebrun Black consulting.
 
- Prince 2 Project Management – Practitioner Award.

Makers is an agile environment which aims to produce self-sufficient developers who can apply their techniques to any situation.
 
I am an external thinker, so talking or writing through things helps me understand: Take a look at some of the time i turned to writing online: [http://lebrunblack.com/].
