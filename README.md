## Abi Travers

An empathetic, enthusiastic and open-minded junior software developer.  

I am an intrinsically motivated and curiously observant [ENFP](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality) with a passion for taking on seemingly unachievable challenges and developing others. 

I see things a bit differently to many other software developers thanks to my diverse expereince and desire to understand people from all walks of life. 

I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to teach myself new skills and then excell in adapting these to any situation. 

I turned a tech startup round when it was about to close down. I taught myself online growth marketing. I worked and adapted to totally different cultures. I achieved a masters in International Development where I helped change local government taxation in Uganda. I project managed multi-million pound catastrophe projects for London's ELectricity Distribution System. 

I am happiest when up against a huge challenge. This is why I have chosen a career in software development with its continuous problems and infinate depth of learning.

I have experience working in an Agile tech team and have been responsible for XP values.


## PROJECTS
| Project       | Summary       | Technologies  | Testing |
| ------------- |---------------| --------------|---------|
| 1. Rock Paper Scissors Part One ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/rps-challenge)) | Three weeks into coding at Makers academy I attempted this challenge after having spent the week prior to it learning the technologies involved. Compare it to other projects to see how far I've come. |Ruby, Sinatra | RSpec |
| 2. Rock Paper Scissors Part Two ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/rps-challenge-improved-))| Two months in, I re-visited it to see how much I had improved. |Ruby, Sinatra | RSpec |
| 3. Marryo-land ([Github](https://github.com/nick-otter/marryo-land))| A re-make of Super Mario Land. The similarity is uncanny.. | JavaScript, HTML5  | Jasmine, Mocha |
| 4. Bank ([Github](https://github.com/abitravers1989/Bank_Tech_Test_Redesigned))| An object-orientated, test driven solution to the bank kata. Second attempt to track my improvement. | Ruby  | RSpec |
| 5. Quark ([Github](https://github.com/FreddieCodes/PDAF-Text-editor)) | A text editor tailored for those who write code. Used as a desktop or web app it interacts with your local file system and automatically formats the code you are writting based on the language you are using. | Electron, Javascript, Node JS, CSS, HTML | Spectron |


## Skills ##

#### Fast Self-Taught Leaner Who Thrives Under Pressure ####

A tenacious ability to teach myself new skills quickly and apply them while under pressure:

Inspitrip:
- Turned this start-up around from 0-2 customers per month to 5-7. This secured an investment of $100,000 for a 10% stake in the product.

- Arrived in Vietnam with no contacts or experience in marketing. Secured a position within 2 weeks then progressed to leading the growth of the company.

- To close my skill gap, I taught myself marketing then created the growth strategy (which was later used to secure the investment). Helped put together the marketing team & create business processes. I managed other team members. I did all of this with no prior experience.

- Taught myself and implemented lean start-up methodology; rapid experimentation followed by careful analysis to inform the next steps. This was used for both the product and growth marketing of it.



#### Excellent Communicator ####

I have a proven ability to effectively communicate with all-types of people:


- At the Energy Institute I worked directly with ex CEOs, CTOs and C-suit management of large oil and gas companies (including BP and Exxon) to assemble co-written papers to influence government policies.

- At UK Power Networks I worked with internal C-suite management and contracting companies (such as Morgan Sindall, ABA) to negotiate significant cost savings. For example I reduced a £12m project to £7.8m.

- My greatest achievement was persuading the CEO, despite a pay and hire freeze, to offer Master’s degree courses to other graduates to support their enhanced development.  

- I was the only English speaker and non-developer while leading the growth at a Vietnamese startup.

- Wrote ad copy in both of the tech startups I worked at. Created the blog for Inspitrip where as well as writting my own post (one of which increased our website traffc from 10 per month to 10,000 in 2 days) I edited and quality-controlled all the other writters. 


## Additional Skills & Qualifications ##

- Photoshop and Illustrate (self-taught). Used to create adverts and landing pages for clients while at Growth Hacking Asia and Lebrun Black consulting.

- Prince 2 Project Management – Practitioner Award.
